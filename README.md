#### END TO END HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION WITH ZENML  AND MLFLOW ####

The project is based on building end to end machine learning pipeline for a house price prediction system.

The pipeline is build using ZenML, a MLOps framework that helps in managing machine learning workflows and MLflow, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.

The primary goal of this project is to predict house price based on various features such as size, location, condition, quality and year_build
